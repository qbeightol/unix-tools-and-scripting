1. I thought the assignment was moderately difficult; it was easy to figure
   out basic solutions to the problems (that, e.g., might have depended on t
   he number of spaces in the output), but it was tricky to find more robust   solutions. I liked the assignment too, and I thought all the problems 
   were interesting.

2. I can't think of anything I want to see in the later lectures.

3. No, I don't have any other questions or concerns.
