Fly me to the moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and MarsIn other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby , kiss meFill my heart with song
and let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adoreIn other words, please be true
In other words, I love youFill my heart with song
Let me sing forever more
You are all I long for
All I worship and adoreIn other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
In other words, I love you.
